  subtitle: "I still can\u2019t believe they approved you for the vessel pilot. I
    thought Zuhair was going to get it for sure. If not him, then Tina. I mean, they
    were really pushing for it. In hindsight, maybe that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t
    get it. Oh, did I tell you about the time Zuhair got wasted at the labs? That
    shit was hilarious, you should have been there."
