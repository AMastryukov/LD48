  subtitle: "Holy shit, everything alright? I\u2019ve lost signal\u2026 did the system
    fail again? I\u2019m detecting an oxygen leak somewhere in your vessel. Look
    at your front panel, it should show the orientations of the oxygen valves the
    way they should be. Look around for those valves and rotate them until they match
    the orientation, then press the red Oxygen Valve Reset button on the left side
    of the panel. Let me know when you do it."
