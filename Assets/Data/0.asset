  subtitle: Hey, do you copy? Remember, we just need to collect the sample. Get down
    to the altitude, grab the rocks and come back. Substation is reading a 21 on
    the W12-0-15 gauge; you should be on your descent now. Signal strength is normal,
    greeble boxes are stable. Everything seems to be good on my end. Tell me if you
    see anything unusual.
