  subtitle: "God damn it, can you hear me? I can\u2019t crack the encryption, it\u2019s
    a stupid one-way with no keys, absolutely fucking moronic design. You need to
    decrypt the diagnostic data from your end so it can get access to the internals.
    There\u2019s a screen with a keypad on your left hand side. Above it is the encryption
    key. You need to type in the mapped key so it decrypts the data and sends it
    to me. Let me know when you\u2019re done."
